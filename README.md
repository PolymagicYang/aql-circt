# aql-circt

AQL is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to automatically transform single-core pipelines into multi-core pipelines that enforce the intended memory consistency model. While AQL's theoretical foundations have been established and verified, it currently lacks a hardware description language (HDL) backend. Converting the DSL into Verilog using traditional tools is challenging due to inconsistencies, usability issues, and the lack of a unified platform. Most existing tools were developed independently and typically rely on Verilog or VHDL as intermediate representations (IRs), making integration difficult. The CIRCT project, a new initiative based on the MLIR/LLVM frameworks, offers a modern set of IRs that address these challenges. Leveraging CIRCT, we can compile AQL code into Verilog in a modular and consistent manner. This project explores the feasibility of representing AQL code using the fsm dialect within CIRCT. Additionally, I implemented a compiler that targets AQL code to the fsm dialect IR in CIRCT, enabling the generation of Verilog code.
